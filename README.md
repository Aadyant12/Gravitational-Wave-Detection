# Gravitational-Wave-Detection
The aim of this project was to determine if the data reported, consisted of gravitational waves originating from mergers of binary black holes or just instrument noise.  

For this, data from 3 Earth-based gravitational wave interferometers (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, and Virgo) was used. Each of the detectors provided 4096 time-series values captured during a 2 second interval.  

1D Convolutional Neural Networks were designed and trained in this project.
