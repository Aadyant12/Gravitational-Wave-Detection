# Gravitational-Wave-Detection
The aim of this project was to determine if the gravitational waves detected, originated from mergers of binary black holes or not.  
For this, data from 3 Earth-based gravitational wave interferometers (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, and Virgo) was used. Each of the detectors provided 4096 values captured during a 2 second interval.
1D Convolutional Neural Networks were designed and trained in this project.
